/*
Waits for a child process "pid" and retrives the child's exit status.
If "pid" is still alive, waits until it terminates. Then, returns the status that "pid" passed to "exit". If "pid" did not call "exit()", but was terminated by the kernel (e.g. killed due to an exception), "wait(pid)" must return -1. It is perfectly legal for a parent process to wait for a child processs that have already terminated by the time the parent calls "wait", but the kernel must still allow the parent to retrieve its child's exit status, or learn that the child was terminated by the kernel.
"wait" must fail and return -1 immediately if any of the following conditions is true:
    
    *"pid" does not refer to a direct child of the calling process. "pid" is a direct child of the calling process if and only if the calling process received "pid" as a return value from asuccessful call to "exec"
    Note: That children are not inherited: if A spawns child B and B spawns child process C, then A cannot wait for C, even if B is dead. A call to "wait(C)" by process A must fail. Similarly, orphaned processes are not assigned to a new parent if their parent process exits before they do.
    *The process that calls "wait" on "pid". That is, a process may wait for any given child at most once.
Processes may spawn any number of children, wait for them in any order, and may even exit without having waited for some or all of their children. Your design should consider all the ways in which waits can occur. All of a process's resources, including its "struct thread", must be freed whether its parent ever waits for it or not, and regardless of whether the child exits before or after its parent.
You must ensure PintOS does not terminate until the initial process exits. The supplied PintOS code tries to so this by calling "process_wait()" (in "userprog/process.c") from "main()" (in "threads/init.c"). We suggest that you implement "process_wait()" according to the comment at the top of the function and then implement the "wait" system call in terms of "process_wait()".
Implementing this system call requires considerably more work than any of the rest.

Each process has an independent set of file descriptors. File descriptors are not inherited by the child process.

Fd 1 writes to the console. Your code to write to the console should write all of the "buffer" in one call to "putbuf()", at least as long as "size" is not bigger than a few hundred bytes. (It is reasonable to break up larger buffers.) Otherwise, lines of text output by different processes may end up interleaved on the console, confusing both human eaders and our grading scripts.
